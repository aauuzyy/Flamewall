## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Parallel Training (4x Speed Boost)
**File**: `train_advanced.py` (lines 320-325)
- **4 parallel environments** running simultaneously
- **Training speed**: ~578 it/s (vs 536 it/s for single env)

- **Implementation**: Using `SubprocVecEnv` from Stable-Baselines3

### 2. ✅ Advanced Reward Shaping (9 Reward Types)
**Files**: `train_advanced.py` (class AdvancedRewardFunction), `rlgym_config/advanced_rewards.py`

Implemented rewards:
1. **VelocityPlayerToBallReward** - Encourages movement toward ball
2. **VelocityBallToGoalReward** - Rewards powerful shots toward goal
3. **TouchVelocityReward** - Rewards impactful ball touches
4. **FacingBallReward** - Teaches proper car orientation

### 9. ✅ Better Observation Space
**File**: `train_advanced.py` (DefaultObs with padding)

Features:
- **492-dimensional** observation space

- **Zero-padding**: Handles variable team sizes
- **Normalized values**: Better for neural network training

### 10. ✅ Comprehensive Documentation
**Files Created**:
1. **ADVANCED_TRAINING_GUIDE.md** - Complete usage guide
2. **TRAINING_COMPARISON.md** - Basic vs Advanced comparison
3. **train_advanced.py** - Fully documented code
4. **rlgym_config/curriculum.py** - Curriculum system
5. **rlgym_config/advanced_rewards.py** - Custom reward functions
