# ⚠️ Python Version Issue

## Problem
Your system has **Python 3.9.0**, but the latest RLGym tools require **Python 3.10+**.

The `rlgym-tools` package uses Python 3.10+ features (like `match` statements) that aren't available in Python 3.9.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade Python (Recommended)
1. Download Python 3.10 or 3.11 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install it
3. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python train_rlgym.py`

### Option 2: Use a Simple Training Example (Works Now)
I've created a **simplified training script** that works with your current Python version.

**Run this instead:**
```powershell
python train_simple.py
```

This uses a basic Rocket League simulator that doesn't require the full RLGym installation.

### Option 3: Create aVirtual Environment with Python 3.10+
If you have multiple Python versions:
```powershell
py -3.10 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_rlgym.py
```

## What's Available Now

✅ **train_simple.py** - Basic RL training (works with Python 3.9)  
✅ **src/bot.py** - Your original hand-coded bot (works now)  
❌ **train_rlgym.py** - Full RLGym training (needs Python 3.10+)

## Recommendation

For the best experience with modern RL tools, upgrade to **Python 3.10** or **3.11**.  
Python 3.9 is becoming outdated for machine learning libraries.
