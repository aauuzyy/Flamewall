Total: 2 reward signals
```

### Advanced Training (train_advanced.py):
```
1. Velocity toward ball: Continuous (encourages movement)
2. Ball velocity toward goal: Continuous (encourages shots)
3. Touch bonus: 1.0 (rewards impactful touches)
4. Facing ball: 0-0.2 (rewards proper orientation)
5. Boost management: ±0.1 (teaches efficiency)
6. Distance penalty: -0.05 (discourages ball-chasing)
7. Aerial reward: 0-0.3 (encourages aerial play)
8. Goal reward: 10.0 (major event)
9. Touch reward: 1.0 (contact bonus)
Total: 9 reward signals with continuous feedback

## 💾 Checkpoint Strategy

### Basic Training:
- Saves every 50K steps
- No opponent archive
- Single model path

### Advanced Training:
- Saves every 100K steps (main checkpoints)
- Saves every 500K steps (self-play opponents)
- Automatic resume from latest
- Multiple model versions preserved

---

## 🎓 Learning Progression

### Basic Training Path:
```
Random → Ball Chaser → Occasional Scorer → Basic Player
(Linear progression, no structure)
```

### Advanced Training Path (with Curriculum):
```
Stage 1: Stationary Shots (Master basics)
   ↓
Stage 2: Moving Ball (Learn interception)
   ↓
Stage 3: Kickoffs (Competitive scenarios)
   ↓
Stage 4: Aerials (Advanced mechanics)
   ↓
Stage 5: Full 1v1 (Put it all together)

(Structured progression, each stage builds on previous)
```
