## Training Configuration

### Recommended Setup:
```python
# In your training script
from training.tsunami_1v3_reward import Tsunami1v3RewardFunction

# Create reward function
reward_fn = Tsunami1v3RewardFunction(
    goal_w=10.0,
    shot_w=3.0,
    save_w=5.0,
    demo_w=4.0,
    # ... other weights
)

# Training opponents
# Phase 1: 1v1
opponents = [FlamewallBot]

# Phase 2: 1v2
opponents = [FlamewallBot, FlamewallBot]

# Phase 3: 1v3
opponents = [FlamewallBot, FlamewallBot, FlamewallBot]
```

## Key Training Tips

### 1. Demos Are Your Friend
- Reducing 1v3 to 1v2 or 1v1 is HUGE
- Train the bot to recognize demo opportunities
- Reward aggressive demo plays heavily

### 2. Boost Starvation
- Deny boost pads to opponents
- Control big boost pads
- Learn efficient boost usage

### 3. Counter the Hivemind
- Flamewall uses hivemind coordination
- Exploit: all bots might commit to ball at once
- Learn to bait and punish poor rotations

### 4. Stay Aggressive
- Playing defensive 1v3 = guaranteed loss
- Constant pressure keeps opponents reactive
- Make THEM defend, not you

### 5. Speed Is Everything
- Fast rotations between offense/defense
- Quick recoveries from challenges
- Maintain supersonic as much as possible

## Expected Training Time

- **Phase 1 (1v1)**: 2-4 hours of training
- **Phase 2 (1v2)**: 5-10 hours of training  
- **Phase 3 (1v3)**: 20-50 hours of training (INTENSE!)

Total: **30-60+ hours** of dedicated training

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (1v1)
- Win rate: 60%+
