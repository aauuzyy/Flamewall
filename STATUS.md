# 🚀 Flamewall RLGym Setup - Current Status

## ⚠️ Python Version Issue Detected

Your system: **Python 3.9.0**  
Required for full RLGym: **Python 3.10+**

## ✅ What's Working Now

### 1. Simplified Training Script
```powershell
python train_simple.py
```
- ✅ Works with Python 3.9
- ✅ Demonstrates PPO training structure  
- ✅ Uses Stable-Baselines3
- ⚠️ Uses simplified physics (not actual Rocket League)

###2. Your Original Bot
```powershell
python run.py
```
- ✅ Your hand-coded Flamewall bot works perfectly
- ✅ No Python version requirements

### 3. All RL Packages Installed
- ✅ Stable-Baselines3
- ✅ PyTorch
- ✅ NumPy
- ✅ TensorBoard
- ✅ Gym

## ❌ What Needs Python 3.10+

### Full RLGym Training
```powershell
python train_rlgym.py
```
- ❌ Requires Python 3.10+ (uses match statements)
- ❌ Needs `rlgym-tools` package
- ✅ Will work after Python upgrade

## 🔧 How to Get Full RLGym

### Option 1: Upgrade Python (Recommended)
1. **Download Python 3.10 or 3.11**:  
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
   
2. **During installation**: Check "Add Python to PATH"

3. **After install**:
   ```powershell
   python --version  # Should show 3.10 or 3.11
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python train_rlgym.py
   ```

### Option 2: Use pyenv or Virtual Environment
If you want to keep Python 3.9:
```powershell
# Install Python 3.10 alongside 3.9
# Then create venv with specific version:
py -3.10 -m venv venv_rlgym
.\venv_rlgym\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 3: Stick with Simple Training
The `train_simple.py` script works now and shows the concepts.  
It's great for learning RL basics!

## 🎯 Recommendations

**For Learning RL Concepts:**
- Use `train_simple.py` - it works now!
- Experiment with PPO parameters
- Learn how training works

**For Real Rocket League Training:**
- Upgrade to Python 3.10 or 3.11
- Then install: `pip install rlgym-tools`
- Use `train_rlgym.py` for real training
