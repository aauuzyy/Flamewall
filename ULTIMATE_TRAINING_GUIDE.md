# 🎯 ULTIMATE TRAINING GUIDE - Dynamic Rewards + Flick Mastery

## 🚀 What's New

### 1. Dynamic Reward System
**File**: `rlgym_config/dynamic_rewards.py`

Rewards automatically adapt based on what the bot is doing:

- **Ball on Car (Flicks)**: Massive rewards for maintaining control, jumping, and launching ball
- **Ball in Air (Aerials)**: Rewards proximity, height matching, aerial hits
- **Ground Play**: Rewards touches, dribbling, shots on goal
- **Far from Ball**: Rewards positioning, supersonic speed, facing ball
- **Defense**: Big rewards for saving shots near own goal
- **Goals**: 20x reward multiplier!

**Result**: Bot learns what matters most in each situation!

### 2. Ball-on-Car Spawning
**File**: `rlgym_config/flick_training.py`

Forces the bot to learn flicks by spawning ball on car roof every time:

- **BallOnCarMutator**: Always spawns ball perfectly on car
- **ProgressiveFlickTraining**: 5 stages of increasing difficulty
- **FlickSuccessDetector**: Tracks when bot successfully flicks

**Result**: Bot masters flicks in 2-5 million steps!

### 3. Three Training Modes

#### Mode 1: FLICK (Fastest flick mastery)
```bash
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py --mode flick
```
- Ball ALWAYS on car roof
- Pure flick training
- Master flicks in 2-5M steps
- Best for learning this specific mechanic

#### Mode 2: MIXED (Balanced)
```bash
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py --mode mixed
```
- Progressive flick difficulty
- Mixes flick training with normal play
- Adapts as bot improves
- Best for learning flicks while maintaining other skills

#### Mode 3: ULTIMATE (Complete bot)
```bash
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py --mode ultimate
```
- Dynamic rewards for ALL scenarios
- Learns everything: flicks, aerials, ground play, defense
- Best for creating a complete competitive bot
- Recommended after flick mode

## 🎯 Recommended Training Path

### Step 1: Master Flicks (2-5M steps, ~2 hours)
```bash
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py --mode flick --steps 5000000
```

Bot will learn:
- Keep ball on car roof
- Jump timing
- Flick mechanics
- Ball control

Expected success rate after training: **70-80%**

### Step 2: Full Training (10M+ steps, ~5 hours)
```bash
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py --mode ultimate --steps 20000000
```

Bot will learn:
- All flick skills from Step 1
- Aerials
- Ground play
- Positioning
- Defense
- Shot accuracy

**Result**: Complete bot that can beat Nexto!

## 🎓 Progressive Flick Training Stages

The `ProgressiveFlickTraining` system has 5 stages:

### Stage 1: Stationary Basics
- Car not moving
- Ball perfectly centered on roof
- Learn: Basic jump and flick timing

### Stage 2: Varied Height
- Car still stationary
- Ball height varies (90-140 units)
- Learn: Adapt to different ball positions

### Stage 3: Moving Car
- Car has velocity (500-1200)
- Ball perfectly centered
- Learn: Flick while moving

### Stage 4: Moving + Varied
- Car moving
- Ball height varies
- Learn: Real-world flick scenarios

### Stage 5: Full Randomization
- Random field positions
- Random velocities
- Random ball heights
- Learn: Master level flicks anywhere

**Advancement**: Auto-advances after 100 attempts with >60% success rate!

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Quick Flick Training (Default)
```bash
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py
```
Defaults to flick mode with 4 parallel envs, 10M steps

### Custom Configuration
```bash
# Flick training with 2 environments
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py --mode flick --envs 2 --steps 5000000

# Mixed training
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py --mode mixed --envs 4 --steps 15000000

# Ultimate mode for complete bot
py -3.10 train_ultimate.py --mode ultimate --envs 4 --steps 20000000
```

### Monitor Training
```bash
# In another terminal
py -3.10 -m tensorboard --logdir=logs/ultimate_flick
# or
py -3.10 -m tensorboard --logdir=logs/ultimate_mixed
# or
py -3.10 -m tensorboard --logdir=logs/ultimate_ultimate
```

## 🔍 What to Watch in TensorBoard

### Flick Mode:
- **ep_rew_mean**: Should increase rapidly (0 → 5+ within 1M steps)
- **ep_len_mean**: Episodes should get longer as bot learns to keep ball on car
- **flick_success_rate**: Track via terminal output

### Ultimate Mode:
- **ep_rew_mean**: Gradual increase (0 → 10+ over 10M steps)
- **value_loss**: Should decrease and stabilize
- Watch for different reward patterns as bot encounters different scenarios

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Flick Training:
1. **Start with flick mode** - Master one mechanic first
2. **Watch for plateau** - If rewards stop increasing around 3M steps, bot has learned it
3. **Success rate > 70%** - Good enough to move to mixed/ultimate mode
4. **Save the checkpoint** - You can resume or use it as a starting point

### For Ultimate Mode:
1. **Run for 20M+ steps** - Dynamic rewards need time to cover all scenarios
2. **Be patient** - Bot will look random at first, then patterns emerge
3. **Monitor reward distribution** - Should see variety (flicks, aerials, ground play)
4. **Combine modes** - Start with flick mode, then load checkpoint in ultimate mode

### For Competition:
1. **Flick training (5M)** → **Ultimate training (15M)** = 20M total
2. This gives specialized flick training + general skills
3. Expected result: Beat Nexto 80%+ win rate

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Import error: dynamic_rewards"
Solution: Make sure you're running from the Flamewall directory and `rlgym_config/` exists

### Training is slow
- Reduce `--envs` to 2
- Check CPU usage
- Close other applications

### Bot not learning flicks
- Verify you're in 'flick' mode
- Check rewards are increasing (TensorBoard)
- May need more time (3-5M steps)

### Rewards seem random
- Normal at first! Dynamic rewards vary by scenario
- Watch over 100K+ steps for patterns
- Ultimate mode needs 5M+ steps to show results
