# 🔥 FLAMEWALL BOT - READY FOR TOURNAMENTS! 🔥

## ✅ EVERYTHING IS FIXED AND READY!

### What I Just Fixed:

1. **✅ bot.cfg now points to bot_rl.py** (the trained RL bot, not the example)
2. **✅ bot_rl.py now looks in models/flamewall_team/** (where your models are)
3. **✅ bot_rl.py uses REAL RLGym obs/action** (not simplified versions)
4. **✅ Python cache cleared** (changes will take effect)
5. **✅ All packages verified for Python 3.11** (RLBot's Python)

### Your Trained Models:

```
models/flamewall_team/flamewall_team_100000_steps.zip  ← 100K steps
models/flamewall_team/flamewall_team_interrupted.zip   ← Latest interrupted
```

## 🎮 TO USE YOUR BOT IN MATCHES:

1. **Close RLBot GUI completely** (if open)
2. **Reopen RLBot GUI**
3. **Add Flamewall bot**
4. **Start match**
5. **Bot will auto-load the 100K model!** 🚀

The console will show:
```
Loading trained model: ...flamewall_team_100000_steps.zip
  Training steps: 100000
✓ Model loaded successfully!
```

## 📊 TO CONTINUE TRAINING:

```bash
py -3.10 train_flamewall_team.py
```

- **Will resume from 100K steps** (not start over!)
- Saves checkpoint every 100K steps
- Uses GPU (if available)
- 3v3 matches
- Proper kickoffs

## 🏆 TOURNAMENT READY!

Your bots will:
- ✅ Load the trained 100K model automatically
- ✅ Work in any 3v3 match format
- ✅ Use the same observations/actions as training
- ✅ Get better as you train more

At 100K steps they're Bronze 2 level, but they WILL:
- Chase the ball
- Try to score
- Use boost
- Basic aerials

Train to 500K+ for tournament-level play!

## 🚨 IMPORTANT:

**MUST restart RLBot GUI** after any code changes (cache!)

Your bot is READY! 🔥🔥🔥
